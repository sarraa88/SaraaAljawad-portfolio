## Background

My name is **Saraa Aljawad**, and I am a PhD student in **Bioinformatics** at the University of Georgia. My academic background in medical imaging (MRI) and data analysis, with a strong interest in applying computational methods to biomedical data.

My current research focuses on **NMR metabolomics**, where I study signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), solvent effects, and reproducibility in high-salinity biological samples such as urine. I am particularly interested in building reproducible analysis pipelines and using statistical and machine learning methods to better interpret complex experimental data.

I have experience with:

-MATLAB.

-Python.

Through this course, I hope to strengthen my skills in **applied data analysis**, improve my ability to design reproducible workflows, and gain more confidence in organizing and communicating complex analyses clearly.

## What I Hope to Learn in MADA

In **Modern Applied Data Analysis**, I am especially interested in learning how to:

-   Apply statistical and modeling techniques to real-world datasets
-   Build clean, reproducible analysis projects
-   Improve code organization and documentation
-   Effectively communicate results through reports and websites

## A Creative Data Visualization Website

A data visualization website I find interesting is *Information Is Beautiful*:

https://informationisbeautiful.net

This website presents data through visually striking graphics that combine design and analysis. I find it interesting because it shows how data analysis can be both informative and engaging.
